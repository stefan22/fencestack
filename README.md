> comparing cost project: running google compute engine/ google app engine vm before getting rid of personal
  shared hosting site.


### google compute engine / shutdown . :-1:
  (it was getting out of control at £2 high already and a forecast of £3 by the end of the month)
- php/apache ubuntu

### google app engine :+1:
  (£0.00 with forescast running at £0.00 by month's end... perfect for death weight/static files) .      
  Serverless load-balanced but not zero-config either.                  
  You have to config/ install sdks, create vms,          
  install gcloud, gutils cli's, set iam/access rules+ roles, 
  config cloud storage/buckets dbs, link-up services,           
  config a domain/dns/ssl etc etc .         
  In all easily £40 cheaper than shared hosting with far far more control and no cpanel
