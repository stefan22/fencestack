- there's tons of info not here like vm size, DB and bucket storage GB, types, regions etc etc
- compare to a reg shared hosting account where you might spend 50 or 60 pounds/year
- not a betting man but i'll say maybe no more than 5 pounds to serve a bunch static assets for a whole year
- plus almost complete access, scale resources at random, ability to build all types of reports/generate data ...
- and that's hardly the basics
